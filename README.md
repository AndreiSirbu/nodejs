# nodejs
On production i've used the `forever` command to run the server in the background
If the server is stopped, you can use `forever start index.js` to start it
To list the running scripts run `forever list`
To stop a specific script, run `forever stop [pid]`
And to stop all scripts, run `forever stopall`
